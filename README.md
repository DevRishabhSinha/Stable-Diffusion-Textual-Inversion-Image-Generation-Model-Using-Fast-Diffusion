# Stable-Diffusion-Textual-Inversion-Image-Generation-Model-Using-Fast-Diffusion
This project contains the custom model created using the DreamBooth Model and Lora for textual inversion based on a custom training dataset. This model was created using fast stable diffusion version 1.5. This model uses textual inversion to generate new images based on text injections. The model is trained on 15 512 x 512 jpg images with 1100 U-Net training steps. Model was trained on Google Virtual Machines through the Colab jupyter environment.
